# Implementation Guides

This directory contains step-by-step implementation guides for each task in the User Management API project.

## Purpose

These guides provide:

- **Procedural Instructions**: How to implement specific features
- **Code Examples**: Complete, copy-paste ready code
- **Verification Steps**: How to test and validate your implementation
- **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## How These Guides Work

### Structure

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - What you're building and why
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation** - Detailed instructions
4. **Testing and Verification** - How to confirm it works
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps** - What to implement next

### Relationship to Learning Journal

| Implementation Guides    | Learning Journal                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **"How to implement X"** | **"Why we implement X this way"** |
| Procedural steps         | Conceptual understanding          |
| Code to copy             | Insights and discoveries          |
| Task completion          | Knowledge capture                 |

## How to Use These Guides

### For Implementation

1. **Start with the Overview** - Understand what you're building
2. **Check Prerequisites** - Ensure you have everything needed
3. **Follow Step-by-Step** - Implement each step in order
4. **Test Your Work** - Run verification steps
5. **Troubleshoot Issues** - Check the troubleshooting section
6. **Move to Next Task** - Continue with the next guide

### For Learning

1. **Read the Overview First** - Understand the context
2. **Cross-Reference with Journal** - Read the related journal entry for insights
3. **Implement the Code** - Follow the steps hands-on
4. **Experiment and Modify** - Try variations and see what happens
5. **Review the Why** - Go back to the journal entry to understand decisions

### For Team Knowledge Sharing

1. **Use for Code Reviews** - Reference guides when reviewing implementations
2. **Onboarding New Developers** - Share guides for getting started
3. **Standardization** - Ensure consistent implementation patterns
4. **Documentation** - Reference guides in API documentation

## File Naming Convention

Guides follow this pattern: `XX-task-name.md`

- `XX` - Sequential number (01, 02, 03...)
- `task-name` - Descriptive kebab-case name
- Corresponds to task numbers in `../tasks.md`

## Quality Standards

Each guide must:

- âœ… **Work End-to-End** - Code can be copied and run successfully
- âœ… **Include Verification** - Steps to test the implementation
- âœ… **Cover Edge Cases** - Handle common error scenarios
- âœ… **Provide Context** - Explain why each step is needed
- âœ… **Be Self-Contained** - Include all necessary code and explanations
- âœ… **Cross-Reference** - Link to related journal entries and external resources

## Contributing to Guides

When adding new guides:

1. **Create New File**: Follow naming convention `XX-task-name.md`
2. **Use Template**: Follow the established structure
3. **Include Verification**: Add testing steps
4. **Add Troubleshooting**: Document common issues
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link to journal entries
6. **Update This README**: Add the new guide to the list

## Best Practices

### For Following Guides

1. **Read First, Implement Second** - Understand before coding
2. **Test Each Step** - Don't wait until the end to test
3. **Ask Questions** - If something isn't clear, investigate
4. **Document Discoveries** - Add insights to the journal

### For Creating Guides

1. **Test Your Code** - Ensure everything works before publishing
2. **Be Explicit** - Don't assume prior knowledge
3. **Include Error Handling** - Show how to handle failures
4. **Provide Context** - Explain the "why" behind decisions
